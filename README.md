# Uni-fyed Landing Page
My first milestone project focuses on developing a landing page for Uni-fyed Language Exchange (Uni-fyed), an online
language exchange platform for university students. The landing page will be built in order to allow potential 
customers to get more information about the platform before signing up. It will also act as an information point 
for any language lecturer that wants to recommend this platform to their students. 

Uni-fyed is an original idea that I have been working on for the past year and have been a part of two different
entrepreneur programs to help me develop the idea further. These programs were called Student Inc. and IGNITE and
were both based in Cork.


## UX: 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly landing page that will provide 
customers with relevant information about the Uni-fyed platform. The landing page will encourage potential 
customers to sign up/log in or contact the Uni-fyed team for more information. 
The landing page has two target audiences: University language students and University language lecturers. 

The secondary goal of this project is to put the skills I have learned so far from the Code Institute course to 
the test. Also, given the amount of independent learning that will take place during the development, I am hoping 
that these skills will have improved upon the project’s completion.  

### User Stories 
#### Language Student Goals
The central target audience for this landing page is University language students. This target audience can be broken 
into two separate groups. These being local students and exchange students.

As a university language student, I want: 
1. A visually appealing landing page no matter what device I use. 
2. The ability to easily navigate through the landing page the first time I visit.
3. The information provided to be clear, organised, and easy to understand.
4. Knowledge of the price to use the platform before signing up.
5. Options to find out more information before signing up.
6. The ability to contact Uni-fyed for more information. 
7. The ability to sign up.
8. The ability to log in. 

#### Language Lecturer Goals 
The main influencers that will promote and make the language students aware of the platform are the language lecturers. 

As a language lecturer, I want: 
1. The ability to easily navigate through the landing page, so that I can find the relevant information.
2. A visually appealing landing page that looks professional and trustworthy.
3. Simple, concise messaging that outlines offering clearly. 
5. Options to find out more information before promoting platform to students.
6. The ability to contact Uni-fyed for more information.

### Developer Goals 
I am the founder of Uni-fyed Language Exchange Ltd. Therefore, the end goals for this landing page 
are personal as well as business orientated.

1. Minimal and professional design that evokes a positive user experience from target 
audience increasing their trust in brand.
2. A landing page that encourages language students to sign up and encourages language 
lecturers to promote platform.
3. A professional looking project that I will be proud to put in my portfolio.

### Wireframes 
After the user stories were completed, I used Balsamiq to draw up wireframes to lock in the important 
content I wanted to display for each section of the landing page. They were also a great help in figuring 
out how to display the landing page on different screen sizes. You can find a link to the wireframes sections below.

* [Home](https://github.com/Callymags/Uni-fyed-Landing-Page/blob/master/wireframes/Wireframes-MP1-Home.pdf)
* [About](https://github.com/Callymags/Uni-fyed-Landing-Page/blob/master/wireframes/Wireframes-MP1-About.pdf)
* [Contact](https://github.com/Callymags/Uni-fyed-Landing-Page/blob/master/wireframes/Wireframes-MP1-Contact.pdf)

As you can see, some features of the deployed site (e.g navbar and about section) are not an exact match to the design I had 
laid out in my wireframes. 

There are also some additional features (e.g sign up/ log in modals) that were not thought of until I reached the final stages of the 
project.

## Features 
### Landing Page Features
* Background colour: The sections of the landing page switch between a shade of white and green which makes 
them more identifiable. 
* Fonts: The headings are in bold and are of a different font-family to the content which makes it stand out. 
The content also has a specific font-family.
* Navbar: The navbar is set to stick to the top of the screen. It also has a responsive toggle hamburger for 
smaller devices which will keep the navbar from looking cluttered.
* Navbar link items: The navbar links enable users to navigate the page easily. Each link changes colour once hovered 
over. The Sign-Up link is styled as a button as it is meant to stand out from the rest of the navbar items.
* Internal links: Most of the navbar items are internal links that scroll down to the indicated section of the page. 
* External links: The social media links in the footer open in a separate tab. However, there is not yet any dedicated 
social media pages to associate with these links. 
* Home section jumbotron: The jumbotron acts as a quick source of information that tells the users what Uni-fyed is for, 
how much the service costs, and features a button that serves as a call to action for new users to sign up.
* About section video: The video allows users to get a visual image of the site’s potential and how it could help them.  
* Images & icons: The images and consistently styled icons enable the page’s text information to be broken up and be more 
easily understood as a result of its visually appealing sections that maintain the user’s attention.
* Contact Us section: This simple form enables users to ask any questions not covered by the information provided on the 
landing page. 
* Sign up/ Log in Modals: Pop ups include forms that validate the user’s information. 
* T&Cs and Privacy Policy Modals: Pop ups include legal mumbo jumbo that creates a more professional image for the brand.
* Title bar favicon: The title bar displays the Uni-fyed logo in favicon format instead of the default favicon.

### Features left to implement 
* Social Media accounts: Uni-fyed social media accounts need to be created in order to direct users from the social 
media links to these platforms. 
* Navbar dropdown: On smaller devices the navbar dropdown does not close automatically once clicking on one of the nav 
items. Further knowledge of JavaScript is needed to develop this feature.
* Sign up/ Log in/ Contact Us forms functionality: The personal information inputted into these forms needs to be stored 
in a database (backend wizardry not yet understood).
* Payment section: A payment section needs to be developed for users once signing up.
* Domaine name: Landing page needs to be linked to Uni-fyed.com domain name bought on GoDaddy.com.

* iPad (Safari)
* Fujitsu Lifebook A512 (Google Chrome)
* Hp L1906 (Google Chrome)

Google Chrome Developer Tools was also used to test the responsiveness of the site using the following devices. 
* Moto G4 
* Galaxy S5
* Pixel 2 
* Pixel 2 XL
* iPhone 5/SE
* iPhone 6/7/8
* iPhone 6/7/8 Plus

### Browser Compatibility
Browser compatibility was physically tested across the different browsers listed below: 
* Google Chrome Version 89.0.43389.114
* Microsoft Edge Version 89.0.774.68
* Mozilla Firefox Version 87.0

[Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) was used to run browser compatibility tests on the browsers listed below:
* Safari 14 
* Internet Explorer 11

The website was compatible on all browsers except for Internet Explorer 11 which decided to display my jumbotron 
vertically over the navbar section all the way through to the about section. The problem can be seen [here](testing/browser-compatibility/IE-11-screenshot.jpg)


### Code Validation 
1. HTML validated using [W3C Markup Service](https://validator.w3.org/). You can view the results below 

* [W3C Markup Service HTML Results.](testing/code-validation/w3-html-validator.jpg)

The validator displays an error with text being inserted within the iframe
tags in the About section. However, I have chosen to keep the content there as this was the method shown in the iframe lessons for
Code Institute. I also researched the problem online and came across a thread on github which indicated that this was a problem with the 
validator and not the code. You can view the thread [here.](https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/592)

2. CSS code validated using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors were found. You can view the results below.

* [W3C Markup Service CSS Results.](testing/code-validation/w3-css-validator.jpg)

## Bugs Encountered 
* **Navbar not expanding down with dropdown toggler.**
The toggler would not expand the navbar down properly because the navbar was adjusted to have a relative position. 
Once the relative position of the navbar was removed, the dropdown worked no problem.

* **Navbar displaying over the section headers.** 
This bug was due to the navigation bar being a certain fixed height. A thread on Stackoverflow recommended to add padding 
to the top of the section headers and it worked. You can view the thread [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10336194/top-nav-bar-blocking-top-content-of-the-page)

* **Top of hero image cut off by navbar.**
The top of the hero image was being displayed under the navbar. To solve this, the navbar position was changed from a fixed to a sticky position.

* **Iframe video not responsive.**
The iframe would not adjust to different screen sizes so media queries were added at different breakpoints to custom style the height and width of the iframe.

* **Images in How it Works section displaying in wrong area on mobile devices.**
This section has different styles for different screen sizes. The problem for mobile was that the image tags for the second and fourth row would be displayed under the 
written content as a result of the styling used. To counteract this, the images were duplicated in these sections and 
the bootstrap display (d-none) classes were used to display one of the images while hiding the other image 
depending on the screen size.

* **Sign Up Modal form not validating.**
The sign up modal would not validate the form sections. The reason for this was that the submit button for the form was outside of the form tag 
which resulted in the form not validating.
