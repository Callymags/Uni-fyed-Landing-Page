# Uni-fyed Landing Page
My first milestone project focuses on developing a landing page for Uni-fyed Language Exchange (Uni-fyed), an online
language exchange platform for university students. The landing page will be built in order to allow potential 
customers to get more information about the platform before signing up. It will also act as an information point 
for any language lecturer that wants to recommend this platform to their students. 

Uni-fyed is an original idea that I have been working on for the past year and have been a part of two different
entrepreneur programs to help me develop the idea further. These programs were called Student Inc. and IGNITE and
were both based in Cork. I am hoping to release the full developed site for testing with the help of the UCC 
School of Languages in September 2021.


## UX: 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly landing page that will provide 
customers with relevant information about the Uni-fyed platform. The landing page will encourage potential 
customers to sign up/log in or contact the Uni-fyed team (consisting of me, myself, and I) for more information. 
The landing page has two target audiences: University language students and University language lecturers. 

The secondary goal of this project is to put the skills I have learned so far from the Code Institute course to 
the test. Also, given the amount of independent learning that will take place during the development, I am hoping 
that these skills will have improved upon the projectâ€™s completion. 
 

### Language Student Goals
The central target audience for this landing page is University language students. This target audience can be 
broken into two separate groups. These being local students and exchange students. 

Player goals are:
* Intuitive landing page that can be navigated easily.
* Responsive site for mobiles and laptops.  
* Visually appealing, consistent, and professional design that increases trust in platform.
* Navigation sections to be clearly distinguishable.
* Information displayed is relevant and easy to understand.

### Language Lecturer Goals 
The main influencers that will promote and make the language students aware of the platform 
are the language lecturers. 

Language lecturer goals are: 
* Landing page to be intuitive and easy to navigate. 
* Landing page displays offering clearly.
* Design looks professional and increases trust in brand and evokes a positive user experience. 
 


### Developer and Business Goals 
I am the founder of Uni-fyed Language Exchange Ltd. Therefore, the end goals for this landing page 
are personal as well as business orientated.

* Minimal and professional design that evokes a positive user experience from target 
audience increasing their trust in brand.
* A landing page that encourages language students to sign up and encourages language 
lecturers to promote platform
* A professional looking project that the developer is proud to put in their portfolio. 

### User Stories 
After a general summary of the different user goals, user stories were created to pinpoint key 
features and content needed on the landing page. 

As a university language student, I want: 
1. A visually appealing landing page no matter what device I use.
2. The ability to understand how the landing page works the first time I visit. 
3. The ability to easily navigate through the landing page.
4. The information provided to be clear, organised, and easy to understand.
5. Knowledge of the price to use the platform before signing up.
6. Options to find out more information before signing up.
7. The ability to contact Uni-fyed for more information. 

As a language lecturer, I want: 
1. The ability to easily navigate through the landing page, so that I can find the relevant information.
2. A visually appealing landing page that looks professional and trustworthy.
3. Simple, concise messaging that outlines offering clearly. 
5. Options to find out more information before promoting platform to students.
6. The ability to contact Uni-fyed for more information.

### Wireframes 
After the user stories were completed, I used Balsamiq to draw up wireframes to lock in the important 
content I wanted to display for each section of the landing page. They were also a great help in figuring 
out how to display the landing page on different screen sizes. You can find a link to the wireframes sections below.
