# Uni-fyed Landing Page
Uni-fyed is an online language exchange platform that enables language learners in universities to find
language partners on their own campus so that they can practice speaking the languages they are learning. 
The platform enables users to find a partner very easily while also allowing them to find someone with 
the same interests and hobbies as them which makes for a more effective language exchange. 

This project focuses on developing a landing page for potential customers to get more information 
about the platform. The project consists of five sections: header, home, about, contact, and the footer.

I have been working on developing the idea for the Uni-fyed platform for the past year and have been a part of two 
different entrepreneur programs to help me develop the idea further. These programs were called Student 
Inc. and IGNITE. I am hoping to release it for testing with the help of the UCC School of Languages in 
September 2021.
